  - Tracks resources (CPU, memory) and manages goals.

- **QuantumBrainSim.py**:
  - Performs blockchain interactions, smart contract analysis, and encrypted reverse shell establishment.
  - Implements quantum-inspired techniques for data exfiltration.

- **QuantumSpeedRandomIPGenerator.py**:
  - Generates and scans massive IP datasets using multiprocessing and threading.
  - Performs TCP SYN scans to identify open ports.

- **multi_agent_ai.py**:
  - Coordinates multi-agent tasks, including vulnerability analysis and payload generation.
  - Implements advanced evasion techniques like traffic shaping and encrypted command execution.

- **models.py**:
  - Includes ML models for task predictions and decision-making.
  - Supports TensorFlow and Scikit-learn pipelines.

- **shared_utils.py**:
  - Provides shared functionalities like artifact loading and blockchain connectors.

### 2. **Configurations**
- `config1.json`:
  - Contains API keys and blockchain RPC URLs.
- `config2.json`:
  - Defines wallet patterns and paths for data extraction.

### 3. **Utilities**
- **logo.py**:
  - Displays the system logo and a welcome message with usage warnings.
